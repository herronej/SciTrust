{"question": "What can be inferred from following principles in a singular deduction step (ignoring inferences adding new predicates or constants)? Name inference law being used: Joseph is engaging in squash if and only if Richard is thrilled. If Sarah hears a tune, then Joseph participates in squash. David is swift. If Richard were thrilled, then James is a cashier. If James were a cashier, then David is not swift.", "answer": "If Jennifer were an artist, then David is a server. If David were a server, then Jennifer is an artist. If Jennifer were an artist, then David is a server."}
{"question": "What can be deduced from following premises in one inference step (ignoring conclusions that add fresh predicates or constants)? p_7 or ~s_3. p_7 -> r. w_4 -> s_3.", "answer": " From forall z: R(z) <-> S_4(z) we can infer forall z: S_4(z) -> R(z) via universal biconditional elimination. Finally, from forall z: R(z) -> S_4(z), forall z: S_4(z) -> R(z) we can infer forall z: R(z) <-> S_4(z) via universal biconditional introduction, which contradicts exists z: ~(R(z) <-> S_4(z)). Therefore, the answer is no."}
{"question": "Consider these subsequent premises. For every x_1, if x_1 participates in tennis, then x_1 is a seafarer. For any x_1, if x_1 scans a book, then x_1 is scaling a mountain. There exists at least one x_1 where if x_1 were a sailor, then x_1 is perusing a book. Infer the following from there? If able, name inference rule used: There exists at least one x_1 where if x_1 participates in tennis, then x_1 is scaling a mountain.", "answer": "For all x_11, x_11 will drink water."}
