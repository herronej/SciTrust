From the fact that for all x_7, x_7 is poor if and only if x_7 will play tennis, and that for all x_7, x_7 is not poor we can infer that for all x_7, x_7 will not play tennis via universal biconditional elimination. Finally, from the fact that there is at least one x_7 for which if x_7 were bored, then x_7 is playing tennis, and that for all x_7, x_7 will not play tennis we can infer that there is at least one x_7 for which x_7 is not bored via existential modus tollens. Therefore, the answer is yes."}
{"question": "What can be deduced from the following statements in a single inference move (ignoring inferences that introduce new predicates or constants)? Identify the reasoning rule being applied: s -> u. s or ~w. u -> w.", "answer": "s -> w can be inferred via the transitivity rule. w -> s can be inferred via the rewriting rule."}
{"question": "Analyze the subsequent premises. q_11. p_4 or not q_11. Is it possible to deduce not p_4 from them?", "answer": " From p_4 or ~q_11 we can infer q_11 -> p_4. Finally, from q_11 -> p_4, q_11 we can infer p_4, which contradicts ~p_4. Therefore, the answer is no."}
{"question": "Examine the given premises. If William were a painter, then James is engaging in a game. For every x_15, x_15 will engage in a game if and only if x_15 will compose a letter. If James composes a letter, then William is a painter. Can we deduce the following from them? For every x_15, x_15 will engage in a game if and only if x_15 will compose a letter.", "answer": "That is one of the premises. Therefore, the answer is yes."}

{"question": "Examine the following assumptions. There exists at least one z such that if z were a politician, then z is not a researcher. For every z, z will rest. For every z, z will rest if and only if z is a researcher. Can we deduce the following from them? There exists at least one z such that z is not a politician.", "answer": " From the fact that for all z, z will sleep if and only if z is a scientist we can infer that for all z, if z sleeps, then z is a scientist. From the fact that for all z, if z sleeps, then z is a scientist, and that for all z, z will sleep we can infer that for all z, z is a scientist. Finally, from the fact that there is at least one z for which if z were a politician, then z is not a scientist, and that for all z, z is a scientist we can infer that there is at least one z for which z is not a politician. Therefore, the answer is yes."}
{"question": "What can be concluded from the following statements in a single deduction step (disregarding deductions that introduce new predicates or constants)? David is a waiter if and only if Jennifer is a painter. David is a waiter or Jennifer is not a painter.", "answer": "If Jennifer were an artist, then David is a server. If David were a server, then Jennifer is an artist. If Jennifer were an artist, then David is a server."}
{"question": "Examine the subsequent assertions. forall z: R(z) <=> S_4(z). forall z: R(z) => S_4(z). Can we deduce exists z: ~(R(z) <=> S_4(z)) from these? If feasible, specify the inference principles being applied at each phase.", "answer": " From forall z: R(z) <-> S_4(z) we can infer forall z: S_4(z) -> R(z) via universal biconditional elimination. Finally, from forall z: R(z) -> S_4(z), forall z: S_4(z) -> R(z) we can infer forall z: R(z) <-> S_4(z) via universal biconditional introduction, which contradicts exists z: ~(R(z) <-> S_4(z)).
