From the fact that for all x_15, if x_15 were a cashier, then x_15 is a doctor, and that there is at least one x_15 for which if x_15 were a doctor, then x_15 is taking a plane we can infer that there is at least one x_15 for which if x_15 were a cashier, then x_15 is taking a plane via existential transitivity. Finally, from the fact that for all x_15, if x_15 takes a plane, then x_15 is a cashier, and that there is at least one x_15 for which if x_15 were a cashier, then x_15 is taking a plane we can infer that there is at least one x_15 for which x_15 will take a plane if and only if x_15 is a cashier via existential biconditional introduction.

{"question": "Here are some premises to think about. For every x_6, either ~P_6(x_6) or T(x_6) must hold true. It's universally true that P_3(x_6) is equivalent to W(x_6) for all x_6. Surely, for any x_6, P_6(x_6) or W(x_6) is valid. Whenever T(x_6) is true, so is P_3(x_6). Is it possible to deduce that there exists an x_6 where ~P_3(x_6) is true?
