As the spacecraft still travels in the same direction, its vertical speed is $0$ at this instant; therefore the current point is the perigee of the new orbit, and the perigee stays the same.\n\nSimilarly, a burn opposite the direction of motion decreases instantaneous speed, decreasing $a$, meaning that the perigee decreases.\n\nThe other four burns are perpendicular to the direction of motion, so increase the satellite\u2019s speed, though only slightly. For the burns towards\/away from Earth, vertical speed is nonzero at this point. Therefore, after a short time (or a short time ago), the spacecraft is (or was) at a lower position, which means perigee is lower.\n\nFor the last burn, they are perpendicular to the radial vector, so vertical speed remains $0$ at this point. As the satellite\u2019s speed has slightly increased, the same logic as a small prograde burn applies, meaning perigee stays the same."}

Using Cepheids involves being able to measure the magnitudes of the Cepheids over a period of time and being able to detect the magnitude of the changes in order to determine said period. However, because the absolute magnitude of a Cepheid must be determined by the period, it cannot be used once the oscillations in apparent magnitude become so small that the period cannot be determined.
